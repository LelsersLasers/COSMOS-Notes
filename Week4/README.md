# The Fan Favorite

## Key Concepts

- We used OpenCV cascade models to detect faces, and then trig a PID controller to calculate the angle to the face and update our two servos accordingly.
- We used a sound sensor to detect claps to toggle the fan on and off.
- We used LEDs to indicate the state of the fan.
- We used Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make an interactive website to control the fan and view the camera.
