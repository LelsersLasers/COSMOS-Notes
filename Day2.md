### Ethics intro

- Ethically delemas in robotics
	- Focus on pratical questions
	- Self driving car gets in accident
		- Who is responsible?
- What makes a (moral) desicion right/wrong?
	- Utilitarianism
		- Greatest good for greatest number
			- Happiness, wellbeing, etc
		- Each person's happiness/wellbeing/etc is equally important
		- Look at all consequences
		- Predict consequences, then pick the best one
			- There can be disagreement on what is best
		- Example desicion:
			- Choice of which charity to donate to
				- Pick the one that will do the most "good"
			- Self-driving cars
				- Pros:
					- Fewer accidents
					- Less traffic
					- More accessible tran
				- Issues/disagreements:
					- How to handle accidents?
						- How to decide the consquences of a "controlled" crash?
						- Favour saving most lives?
						- Favour saving the driver/occupants?
						- Favour the rule followers?
						- Let the driver pick?
				- Could be disagreement on which option creates the most good
	- Deontology
		- Focus on the action itself
		- Some actions are inherently wrong
		- Morality consists of duties which do not reduce to bringing about the most good
			- Non-maleficence: do not harm others
			- Beneficence: help others
			- Justice
			- Fidelity: keep promises
			- etc
		- Example Deontology ideas
			- Framing an innocent person to quell unrest is wrong
		- Considered judgement
			- Conflicting duties, pick the best one
				- Ex: stopping to save someone vs keeping promise to meet friend for coffee
			- Rather vague/unsatisfying
				- Similar to utilitarianism
				- But captures moral reasoning process
- How to argue for a position?
	- Analogies to similar cases
	- Coherence with other moral judgements

### Ethics essays

- Purpose: think about the ethical dilemmas raised by new science and technology
	- New science and technology can produce a lot of good, but also a lot of harm
		- Nuclear energy: good for energy, but also weapons
		- AI: good for automation, efficiency, but also job loss and deepfakes
	- Developments can create new questions
		- Machine learning and intellectual property
		- Genetic engineering and designer babies/human enhancement
- Goal: write an essay of a dilemma choosen by cluster
	- Must be a matter/topic that reasonable people can disagree about
		- Should we permit X?
		- How should we regulate X?
		- Do the benefits of X outweigh the harms?
		- Do people have a right to X?
	- Pick a side
		- Convince the reader that your position is correct
- Requirements
	- Give credit to those who helped you
	- No ChatGTP
	- Title page
		- Title, cluster number, cluster name
		- Not name on the title page
	- Max 5 pages
		- Including tables/figures
	- Max 1 page bibliography
		- APA or MLA
	- 1.5 line spacing
	- 12pt font
	- Calibri, Times New Roman, Arial
	- 1 inch margins
- Rubric
	- Be straightfoward and organized
	- Can give problems with your solution
	- Concluding summary
- Use research papers + opinion pieces

### Brainstorming

- Definition of a robot?
	- Purpose
	- Some level of autonomy
	- Physical tasks/componenets
- Need to split AI and robotics for the essay
- Tasks a robot is used for:
	- Manufacturing
		- Efficiency
		- Cheaper
		- Takes away jobs
	- Rescue
		- Safer for humans
		- Can go places humans can't
		- Can make a mistake
		- Expensive
			- Wealth inequality/gap
	- Self-driving cars
		- Safer
		- More efficient
		- Can make a mistake/cause accidents
			- Who to prioritize saving?
	- Military
		- Safer for US soldiers
		- Lack of human judgement/responsibility
	- Music playing robot
		- Play live music perfectly without need of humans
		- Less creative, not personal
	- Surgery
		- Better success rate
		- Who is responsible for mistakes?
	- Therapy
		- Less stress
		- More accessible
		- Create disconnect, not human
	- Learning
		- More efficient, cheaper
		- No sick days
		- Can give more people access to education
		- Takes away job
		- Takes away teacher-student interaction/role model
		- Not designed to help all students
	- Elder care
		- More efficient, cheaper, more accessible
		- Not personal, missing human touch
	- Cleaning
	- Packing
	- Soccer
	- Research/exploration
	- Surveillance
		- Loss of privacy
	- Agriculture
- Art Robot
	- Creative field - not seen as necessary/very personal
- Surgical Robot
	- Can raise success rates, but can fail 
- Therapy Robot
	- Lower stress, but can create disconnect/not human
- Educational Robot
	- Can serve areas that do not have teachers, no sick days; taking jobs away and students miss out on experience where you learn character, robots cannot necessarily help all students
- Elderly Care Robot
	- Elderly people might really need human interaction, can give privacy
- Search and Rescue
	- Robots can rescue from dangerous environment, can be very expensive - wealth inequality - can detect people under snow, might miss some people. 
- Robots for crime prevention/management	
	- Might have bias/incorrect ID, but lowers human danger
- Exploration Robots 
	- Space. Leave protected habitats alone, but can explore new places
